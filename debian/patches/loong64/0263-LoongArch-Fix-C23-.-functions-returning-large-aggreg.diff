Subject: [PATCH 263/301] LoongArch: Fix C23 (...) functions returning large
 aggregates [PR114175]

We were assuming TYPE_NO_NAMED_ARGS_STDARG_P don't have any named
arguments and there is nothing to advance, but that is not the case
for (...) functions returning by hidden reference which have one such
artificial argument.  This is causing gcc.dg/c23-stdarg-6.c and
gcc.dg/c23-stdarg-8.c to fail.

Fix the issue by checking if arg.type is NULL, as r14-9503 explains.

gcc/ChangeLog:

        PR target/114175
        * config/loongarch/loongarch.cc
        (loongarch_setup_incoming_varargs): Only skip
        loongarch_function_arg_advance for TYPE_NO_NAMED_ARGS_STDARG_P
        functions if arg.type is NULL.
